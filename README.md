# Spring File Upload

Simple app to show how to upload/download a file with Spring, inspired by [this article](https://frontbackend.com/spring-boot/spring-boot-upload-file-to-filesystem) but I modified the initial project.

To make it work, install JDK 8 or more if not installed, then Postgresql and create a database called file_upload.
